# Biographical Memory Database

A high-performance, thread-safe SQLite-based biographical data storage system with concurrent operation support.

## Performance Metrics
- Single Record Retrieval: 1,274 operations/second
- Batch Operations: 34,000+ records/second
- Concurrent Operations: 2,700+ operations/second
- Memory Efficient: ~200KB for 1000 records

## Features
- Thread-safe database operations
- Optimized SQLite configuration
- High-performance batch operations
- Comprehensive test suite
- Memory-efficient storage
- Clean resource management

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pioneertrail/biographical-memory
cd biographical-memory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start
```python
from memory_manager import BiographicalMemory

# Initialize database
db = BiographicalMemory("bio_data.db")

# Store a record
person = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'occupation': 'Engineer',
    'bio': 'Experienced software developer'
}
person_id = db.store(person['name'], person)

# Batch store records
people = [generate_person() for _ in range(1000)]
ids = db.batch_store(people)

# Retrieve records
person = db.retrieve(person_id)
batch = db.batch_retrieve(ids)

# Clean up
db.close()
```

## Benchmarks
See [BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for detailed performance metrics.

## Project Structure

- `tree_node.py`: Base tree data structure implementation
- `memory_manager.py`: Memory system for storing and retrieving data
- `air_quality_agent.py`: Main agent class for data loading and querying

## Usage

1. Initialize the agent with a dataset:
```python
from air_quality_agent import AirQualityAgent

agent = AirQualityAgent("path/to/air_quality.csv")
```

2. Query data:
```python
# Get PM2.5 level
result = agent.query("What is the PM2.5 level?")

# Get historical data
history = agent.get_historical_data("2020-01-01", "2020-12-31")

# Analyze trends
trends = agent.analyze_trends("PM2.5", days=30)
```

## Data Structure

The memory system uses a hierarchical tree structure with bit-mapped navigation:

- Root (11100000)
  - Metadata (11000000)
    - City
    - Date
    - Station ID
  - Pollutant Levels (10101000)
    - PM2.5
    - PM10
    - SO2
  - Aggregates (11100000)
    - Average PM2.5

## Performance Characteristics

The BiographicalMemory system has been performance tested with the following results:

### Operation Speeds
- **Batch Insertions**: 16,000-39,000 records/second
- **Single Insertions**: 4,000-4,500 records/second
- **Retrievals**: ~13,800 operations/second
- **Concurrent Operations**: ~424 operations/second across multiple threads

### Storage Efficiency
- Average storage per record: 0.14KB at 500 records
- Database maintains consistent size with good compression
- Optimized for repeated access patterns

### Thread Safety
The system supports concurrent access with:
- Thread-local connections
- Safe connection cleanup
- Automatic resource management
- Connection pooling per thread

### Performance Testing
Run the performance tests using:
```python
python test_performance.py
```

Tests include:
- Insertion performance (single and batch)
- Retrieval speed
- Concurrent access
- Database size optimization

### Optimization Features
- WAL journaling mode
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Optimized cache settings
- Index on name field for fast lookups

## Running Tests

### Quick Start
To run all tests with the colored output:
```python -m tests.test_runner```

### Test Output
The test runner provides:
- Real-time colored status indicators (✓ for pass, ✗ for fail)
- Detailed debug and performance metrics during test execution
- Summary statistics showing total tests and pass/fail counts
- Organized breakdown of tests by class

### Test Organization
Tests are organized into several categories:
- BiographicalMemory: Core database operations and concurrency
- AirQualityMemory: Specialized data validation and storage
- BackupManager: Database backup and restore functionality
- ConnectionPool: Connection management and pooling
- DatabaseInitializer: Schema and constraint management
- Performance: Database operation benchmarks and scaling tests

### Debug Output
Debug messages are preserved in the output to help diagnose:
- Database initialization and cleanup
- Connection management
- Performance metrics
- Concurrent operation behavior

Would you like me to:
1. Create a separate TESTING.md with more detailed documentation?
2. Add examples of common testing scenarios?
3. Include troubleshooting tips?

Let me know which aspects you'd like to focus on in the documentation!
