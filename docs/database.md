# Database Documentation

## Overview
The database system uses SQLite with optimizations for both air quality and biographical data storage. It implements connection pooling, proper indexing, and robust error handling.

## Features
- Connection pooling (10 connections max)
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for better concurrency
- Memory-mapped I/O for improved performance
- Automated backup and recovery
- Data validation and constraints
- Comprehensive error handling
- Query optimization through indexes

## Usage Examples
```python
# Initialize with connection pool
memory = AirQualityMemory("air_quality.db", max_connections=10)

# Store data with validation
memory.store(data_string, timestamp)

# Create backup
backup_mgr = BackupManager("air_quality.db", "backups")
backup_path = backup_mgr.create_backup()
```
